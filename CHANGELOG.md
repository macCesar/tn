## [Unreleased]

## [5.4.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- `tn clean` deletes iOS simulators whose runtime is no longer installed. Xcode leaves these behind when a runtime is uninstalled: they still appear in `simctl list`, can never be booted, and take up disk space indefinitely. The command lists what it found grouped by runtime, reports how much space it frees, and asks before deleting anything.
- `tn clean --data` erases contents and settings of installed simulators, keeping the simulators themselves. Booted simulators are skipped.
- `tn clean --runtimes` deletes installed iOS runtimes chosen from a list showing size and last use date, warning when the newest installed runtime is selected. Because deleting a runtime makes its simulators unusable, those are removed in the same run and any recipes left pointing at them are offered for removal.
- `tn generate` reports leftover simulators when it finds them, pointing at `tn clean`.

### Fixed

- `tn generate` no longer regenerated recipes for simulators whose runtime had been uninstalled and then immediately reported them as orphaned, in a loop that repeated on every run. `ti info` still lists those simulators, so the `simctl` check that was already used to detect orphans is now applied when generating too.
- `tn generate` no longer offers to remove every recipe of a platform that `ti info` did not report at all (for instance an unconfigured Android SDK). An empty device list now means "nothing installed" only when the platform was actually inspected; otherwise its recipes are left alone.
- Pressing Ctrl+C at a confirmation prompt exits cleanly instead of printing an `ExitPromptError` stack trace.
- A malformed `~/.tn.json` or `tn.json` no longer takes down every command with a stack trace. The broken file is reported by name and skipped, so `tn list` still works and can be used to find the problem.
- `tn generate` reports a clear message when `ti info` returns something that is not JSON, or when the Titanium CLI is not installed, instead of crashing.
- The `postinstall` script no longer fails with a stack trace when the Titanium CLI is absent.
- `tn rename` rebuilt its recipe list without project recipes, dropping them until the next run.

### Changed

- Recipe files are written indented instead of on a single line. They are meant to be opened and edited by hand.
- Informational messages are printed without an `[INFO]` label. When every line carries one it conveys nothing, and it made warnings and errors blend into the output. `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]` and `[DEBUG]` keep theirs and now stand out.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- `tn list` now groups recipes into 8 labeled categories: iPhone Simulators, iPad Simulators, Android Emulators, iOS Devices, Android Devices, Distribution, Aliases, and General. Within each group, built-in recipes appear before user recipes. The General group is visually sub-clustered by platform (Apple/iOS, Android, parametric, misc) using blank lines.
- `tn generate` shows `[INFO] All recipes are up to date.` when no new recipes are found.

### Fixed

- `tn generate` no longer creates duplicate `-iosXXX` recipes on repeated runs. Two bugs caused it: the same UDID reported under multiple iOS versions by `ti info`, and simulators that only appear under an older iOS version gaining a new suffix on every subsequent run even when their UDID was unchanged.

### Changed

- `tn generate` output is compact: only newly saved recipes are printed, not every device `ti info` finds.
- README recipe tables restructured to match the grouped `tn list` output. Aliases now have their own section. All parametric recipes include descriptions.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added

- **Mac App Store Distribution**: Added built-in recipe for building Mac Catalyst apps for Mac App Store
  - `macstore`: Build for Mac App Store (`--ios --target dist-macappstore`)

  - Creates `.xcarchive` ready for upload via Xcode Organizer
  - Automatically detects installed Mac App Store Distribution certificates
  - No interactive prompts required when certificates are properly configured

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Build for Mac App Store distribution
tn macstore

# Combine with other recipes
tn macstore --verbose
```

### Compatibility

This release complements the Mac Catalyst support introduced in v5.1.0 and requires the official Mac App Store distribution target (`dist-macappstore`) that was added to Titanium SDK 13.1.1.GA.

## [5.1.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- **macOS Support**: Added built-in recipes for building iOS apps for macOS using Mac Catalyst
  - `mac`: Build for macOS (`--platform ios --target macos`)
  - `catalyst`: Alias for `--mac`
  - Requires Titanium SDK 13.1.0+ with macOS build support
  - Works on Apple Silicon Macs running macOS apps via Catalyst

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Build for macOS using Mac Catalyst
tn mac

# Using the catalyst alias
tn catalyst

# Combine with other recipes
tn mac --verbose
```

## [5.0.0] - 2025-08-31

- **FEATURE:** Updated `update-notifier@0.6.0` to `7.3.1` with modern API
- **COMPATIBILITY:** Updated Node.js engine requirement from `>=0.8` to `>=18`

## [4.2.0] - Previous Release

- Adds --prefer-appc and --prefer-ti to override automatic detection to use appc or ti CLI

## [4.0.0] - Previous Release

- Removed the need to use `tn r` or `tn b` thanks to [appc-compat](https://npmjs.com/appc-compat)

## [3.0.0] - Previous Release

## Migration Guide for v5.0.0

### For Users

- **Node.js Requirement:** Upgrade to Node.js 18+ (recommended: Node.js 22+)
- **Discontinued Platforms:** Remove any usage of BlackBerry, Tizen, MobileWeb, or Windows recipes
- **iOS Versions:** Update recipes using `ip6`/`ip7` to modern `ip15`/`ip16` equivalents

### For Developers

- **Colors API:** Replace `'text'.red` with `chalk.red('text')`
- **Prompts:** The new prompt system uses modern async/await patterns
- **Platform Support:** Only iOS and Android platforms are now supported

### Breaking Changes

1. **Node.js 18+ Required:** The CLI no longer supports older Node.js versions
2. **Discontinued Platforms Removed:** BlackBerry, Tizen, MobileWeb recipes no longer exist
3. **Modern Prompts:** Interactive mode uses different keybindings (arrow keys vs numbers)
4. **Secure Dependencies:** Replaced `colors` with `chalk` - custom color extensions won't work

## Recommended Future Improvements

The following improvements are recommended for future versions:

1. **Replace `underscore` with `lodash`** - Modern, better-maintained utility library
2. **Add TypeScript support** - Better developer experience and type safety
3. **Implement automated testing** - Jest or Mocha for comprehensive test coverage
4. **Add ESLint/Prettier** - Consistent code formatting and linting
5. **Setup GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD pipeline for releases
6. **Add JSDoc documentation** - Better code documentation
7. **Implement semantic release** - Automated versioning and changelog generation
